## Project "Towar" is based primarily on derived classes
I started with class Towar that contains name of the product. In the next step, I made derived classes called Towar_Spozywczy (Food Product) and Towar_Gwarancja (Warranty Product). 
In each class, I developed an appropriate Sprzedaj (Sell) function. 
Class Koszyk (basket) contains a list of products. You can add products to the basket using Dodaj-Towar_do-Koszyka (Add Product to Basket) function.
After that, you can print all products with Sprzedaj-Zawartosc-Koszyka (Sell Basket Contents) function.
